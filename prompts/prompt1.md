Two-Sentence Horror Story

Write a two-sentence horror story with a twist. Start with a normal scenario, then deliver an unexpected revelation that leaves readers unsettled.

Tips:
- Create contrast between ordinary first sentence and disturbing second sentence
- Use precise language for maximum impact
- Imply horror rather than explicitly stating it
- Focus on psychological, supernatural, or existential elements
- Let readers' imagination fill in the details
