Two-Sentence Horror Story Prompt

Write a chilling two-sentence horror story that creates a complete narrative with a twist. The first sentence should establish a seemingly normal or innocent scenario, while the second sentence should deliver an unexpected, disturbing revelation that completely changes the context and leaves the reader unsettled.

Guidelines:
- Create a stark contrast between the mundane first sentence and the horrifying second sentence
- Use precise, evocative language to maximize impact with minimal words
- Incorporate psychological horror, supernatural elements, or existential dread
- Leave room for the reader's imagination to fill in the most terrifying details
- Avoid excessive gore or explicit violence; subtle horror is often more effective

Examples of effective approaches:
- Subverting everyday situations
- Playing with perspective shifts
- Revealing something was not as it seemed
- Introducing an unexpected threat or realization
- Creating temporal paradoxes or impossible situations

Remember that the most effective two-sentence horror stories often imply rather than explicitly state the horror, allowing the reader's mind to conjure their own worst fears.
